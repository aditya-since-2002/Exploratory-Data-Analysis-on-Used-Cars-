# Exploratory Data Analysis on Used Cars 
 Through EDA, we are searching for useful insights, and the factors influencing the price of the car and a few takeaways

- Hey there
-  ✨let's begin✨

## What is python?

## Data Pre-processing 
Data processing is the collection and manipulation of data to produce meaningful information.

## Import Python Libraries
>import pandas as pd

>import numpy as np

>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

>import seaborn as sns

>import warnings
 warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

## Reading Dataset
The Pandas library offers a wide range of possibilities for loading data into the pandas DataFrame from files like JSON, .csv, .xlsx, .sql, .pickle, .html, .txt, images etc.

##Data Reduction
Some columns or variables can be dropped if they do not add value to our analysis.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is a machine learning technique that leverages data to create new variables that aren't in the training set. 

## EDA Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the crucial process of performing initial investigations on data to discover patterns to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

## Conclusion
In this article, we tried to analyze the factors influencing the used car’s price.

- Data Analysis helps to find the basic structure of the dataset.
- Dropped columns that are not adding value to our analysis.
- Performed Feature Engineering by adding some columns which contribute to our analysis.
- Data Transformations have been used to normalize the columns.

**Through EDA, we got useful insights, and below are the factors influencing the price of the car and a few takeaways**
- Most of the customers prefer 2 Seat cars hence the price of the 2-seat cars is higher than other cars.
- The price of the car decreases as the Age of the car increases.
- Customers prefer to purchase the First owner rather than the Second or Third.
- Due to increased Fuel price, the customer prefers to purchase an Electric vehicle.
- Automatic Transmission is easier than Manual.
